# Cryptographic-Challenge
A block cipher encrypts 4-digit decimal blocks using a two-step process: a permutation and two digit-wise additions with parts of an 8-digit key. Given one known plaintext-ciphertext pair, I implement the cipher and break it to decrypt a new challenge without knowing the key directly.
